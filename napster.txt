0.  Forward

This is meant to be an open specification.  If you find errors or know of
additional functionality not described hereafter, please send me email.  It
benefits the entire community to have a complete and accurate protocol
specification.  Not only does it allow for clients to be developed for any
platform, but also decreases the strain on the server having to parse out
bad client messages.

Disclaimer: the following information was gathered by analyzing the protocol
between the linux nap client and may not resemble the official windows client
protocol.

1.  Client-Server protocol

each message to/from the server is in the form of
<length><type><data>
where <length> and <type> are 2 bytes each.  <length> specifies the length in
bytes of the <data> portion of the message.  Be aware that <length> and <type>
appear to be in little-endian format (least significant byte goes first).  For
example, in the C language you would encode the number 1 as
	const unsigned char num[2] = { 0x01, 0x00 };
and 256 would be encoded as
	const unsigned char num[2] = { 0x00, 0x01 };
[The above is for illustrative purposes only, there are much quicker ways to
actually encode a number. -ed]

Note that in many cases, strings are passed as double-quoted entries.  For
example, filenames and client id strings are always sent as
	"random band - generic cowboy song.mp3"
or
	"nap v0.8"
Where required, double quotes are used in the description of the messages
below.

Some additional information about use of quotes inside of quotes:
> The answer is, no, it doesn't do escaping of quotes.  If you try searching
> for the phrase 'a "quoted" string' on the windows client, you get no songs
> found, and "invalid search request" printed in yellow in your console
> window.  (don't know what code that is, sorry.)
>
> and no wonder-- a little birdie told me that the client sends this:
>
> FILENAME CONTAINS "a "quoted" string" MAX_RESULTS 100

[contributed by Ben Byer <bbyer@rice.edu>.  -ed]

Note that unlike the IRC protocol, each line does NOT end in \r\n.  The
<length> field specifies exactly how much data you should read.

2.  Message Types

The following section describes the format of the <data> section for each
specific message type.  Each field is denoted with <>.  The fields in a
message are separated by a single space character (ASCII 32).  Where
appropriate, examples of the <data> section for each message are given.

<type> can be one of the following (converted to big-endian):

0	error message [SERVER]

	<message>

2	client login message [CLIENT]

	<username> <password> <port> "<client-info>" <link-type>

	<port> is the port the client is listening on for data transfer.  if
		this value is 0, it means that the client is behind a firewall
		and can only push files outward.  it is expected that requests
		for downloads be made using the 500 message (see below)
	<client-info> is a string containing the client version info
	<link-type> is an integer indicating the client's bandwidth
		0  unknown
		1  14.4 kbps
		2  28.8 kpbs
		3  33.6 kbps
		4  56.7 kbps
		5  64K ISDN
		6  128K ISDN
		7  Cable
		8  DSL
		9  T1
		10 T3 or greater
		
	Example:

	foo badpass 6699 "nap v0.8" 3

3	login ack [SERVER]

	<email>

	the server sends this message to the client after a succesful
	login (2).  If the nick is registered, the <email> address given at
	registration time is returned.  If the nick is not registered, a
	dummy value is returned.

6	alternate login format [CLIENT]

	this message is used when logging in for the first time after
	registering (0x07) a nick

	<nick> <pass> <port> "<client-info>" <linkspeed> <email-address>

	note: this message is similar to the 0x02 message, with the addition	
	of <email-address> on the end

	Example:

	foo foo 6699 "nap v0.8" 3 email@here.com

7	client registration message [CLIENT]

	<nick>

	this message is sent to create an account

	response to this message is one of 8, 9 or 10

8	registration success [SERVER]

	the server sends this when the clients request to register a new
	nickname has succeeded.

9	nickname already registered [SERVER]

	the server sends this message when the nickname the client has
	requested has already been registered by another user

10	invalid nickname [SERVER]

	this server sends this message when the client attempts register
	an invalid nickname [what defines an invalid nickname? -ed]

11	??? [CLIENT]

	[returns "parameters are unparsable" -ed]

14	login options [CLIENT]

	NAME:%s ADDRESS:%s CITY:%s STATE:%s PHONE:%s AGE:%s INCOME:%s EDUCATION:%s

100	client notification of shared file [CLIENT]

	"<filename>" <md5> <size> <bitrate> <frequency> <time>

	<md5> see section "MD5"
	<size> is bytes
	<bitrate> is kbps
	<frequency> is hz
	<time> is seconds
	
	Example:

	"generic band - generic song.mp3" b92870e0d41bc8e698cf2f0a1ddfeac7 443332 128 44100 60

102	remove file [CLIENT]

	<filename>

	client requests to remove file from shared library

200	client search request [CLIENT]

    [FILENAME CONTAINS "artist name"] MAX_RESULTS <max> [FILENAME CONTAINS
"song"] [LINESPEED <compare> <link-type>] [BITRATE <compare> "<br>"] [FREQ
<compare> "<freq>"]

        The artist name and the song name are, obviously, treated
                the same by the server; confirm this for yourself
                on the windows client.

        max is a number; if it is greater than 100, the server will
                only return 100 results.

        <compare> is one of the following:
                "AT LEAST" "AT BEST" "EQUAL TO"

        <link-type> see 0x02 (client login) for a description

        <br> is a number, in kbps

        <freq> is a sample frequency, in Hz

        The windows client filters by ping time inside the client.
                It pretty much has to, and it's easy to see the
                result by setting ping time to at best 100 ms or
                so, and max search terms to 50.  You'll get back
                like 3 results, but the client will still tell you
                that it found "50 results".

        Examples:
                FILENAME CONTAINS "Sneaker Pimps" MAX_RESULTS 75 FILENAME
                         CONTAINS "tesko suicide" BITRATE "AT LEAST" "128"

                MAX_RESULTS 100 FILENAME CONTAINS "Ventolin" LINESPEED
                        "EQUAL TO" 10

	no data.

203	download request [CLIENT]

	<nick> "<filename>"

	client requests to download <filename> from <nick>.  client expects
	to make an outgoing connection to <nick> on their specified data
	port.

	Example:

	mred "C:\Program Files\Napster\generic cowboy song.mp3"

	SEE ALSO: 500 alternate download request

204	download ack [SERVER]

	<nick> <ip> <port> "<filename>" <md5> <linespeed>

205	private message to/from another user [CLIENT, SERVER]

	<nick> <message>

	note the same type is used for a client sending a msg or recieving one

	[Commentary: this message causes problems if you consider linking
	servers together.  With the current one server situation, the server
	just rewrites the message it receives with the name of the client that
	sent it and passes it to the recipient client.  However, in the case
	where the recipient and sender are not on the same server, there is
	loss of information without encapsulating it.  It would have been
	better to put both the sender and recipient because if the servers
	are ever linked they will have to make a new message type for this
	situation.  -ed]

206	get error [SERVER]

	<nick> <filename>

	the server sends this message when the file that the user has
	requested to download is unavailable (such as the user is not logged

3.  MD5

The MD5 sum on the files for the upload list is computed against exactly
300000 bytes at the beginning of the file.  I have verified this :)
Hope this helps :).
The cmdline client (nap v0.7) does do some validation that the file is
consistant with what an MP3 should look like, so it looks like it's
checking the mp3 header for the file (skipping over any ID3 tag at the
beginning of the file).  You might or might not want to do similar
checking in your client.  (I can probably provide you with code for this
since I've dealt with mp3 decoding before).   I know this last bit because
it refused to compute the md5 sum on any test file I created that wasn't
made by pulling the first X bytes out of a valid MP3 (ie, sequential
bytes, or random bytes or anything but valid mp3)
