0.  Forward

This is meant to be an open specification.  If you find errors or know of
additional functionality not described hereafter, please send me email.  It
benefits the entire community to have a complete and accurate protocol
specification.  Not only does it allow for clients to be developed for any
platform, but also decreases the strain on the server having to parse out
bad client messages.

Disclaimer: the following information was gathered by analyzing the protocol
between the linux nap client and may not resemble the official Windows client
protocol.

1.  Client-Server protocol

each message to/from the server is in the form of
<length><type><data>
where <length> and <type> are 2 bytes each.  <length> specifies the length in
bytes of the <data> portion of the message.  Be aware that <length> and <type>
appear to be in little-endian format (least significant byte goes first).  For
example, in the C language you would encode the number 1 as
	const unsigned char num[2] = { 0x01, 0x00 };
and 256 would be encoded as
	const unsigned char num[2] = { 0x00, 0x01 };
[The above is for illustrative purposes only, there are much quicker ways to
actually encode a number. -ed]

Note that in many cases, strings are passed as double-quoted entries.  For
example, filenames and client id strings are always sent as
	"random band - generic cowboy song.mp3"
or
	"nap v0.8"
Where required, double quotes are used in the description of the messages
below.

Some additional information about use of quotes inside of quotes:
> The answer is, no, it doesn't do escaping of quotes.  If you try searching
> for the phrase 'a "quoted" string' on the windows client, you get no songs
> found, and "invalid search request" printed in yellow in your console
> window.  (don't know what code that is, sorry.)
>
> and no wonder-- a little birdie told me that the client sends this:
>
> FILENAME CONTAINS "a "quoted" string" MAX_RESULTS 100

[contributed by Ben Byer <bbyer@rice.edu>.  -ed]

Note that unlike the IRC protocol, each line does NOT end in \r\n.  The
<length> field specifies exactly how much data you should read.

2.  Message Types

The following section describes the format of the <data> section for each
specific message type.  Each field is denoted with <>.  The fields in a
message are separated by a single space character (ASCII 32).  Where
appropriate, examples of the <data> section for each message are given.

<type> can be one of the following (converted to big-endian):

0	error message [SERVER]

	<message>

2	client login message [CLIENT]

	<username> <password> <port> "<client-info>" <link-type> [ <num> ]

	<port> is the port the client is listening on for data transfer.  if
		this value is 0, it means that the client is behind a firewall
		and can only push files outward.  it is expected that requests
		for downloads be made using the 500 message (see below)
	<client-info> is a string containing the client version info
	<link-type> is an integer indicating the client's bandwidth
		0  unknown
		1  14.4 kbps
		2  28.8 kpbs
		3  33.6 kbps
		4  56.7 kbps
		5  64K ISDN
		6  128K ISDN
		7  Cable
		8  DSL
		9  T1
		10 T3 or greater
	<num> build number for the windows client [optional]
		
	Example:

	foo badpass 6699 "nap v0.8" 3

3	login ack [SERVER]

	<email>

	the server sends this message to the client after a succesful
	login (2).  If the nick is registered, the <email> address given at
	registration time is returned.  If the nick is not registered, a
	dummy value is returned.

4       version check [CLIENT]

        <version>

	Server sends [5] if an update is needed. All other responses are
	ignored.

	<version> = string, version 2.0b5a sends "2.0"

5       "auto-upgrade" [SERVER]

        <version> <hostname:filename>

        Napster is out of date, get a new version.
        Or also known as gaping security hole.

        <version>  = string, the new version number.
        <hostname> = string, hostname of upgrade (http) server
        <filename> = string, filename

        Connections are always made to port 80.

        The HTTP Request:
                GET <filename> HTTP/1.0
                Connection: Keep-Alive
                Host: <hostname>

        Expected HTTP Response.
                Content-Length: <size>
                Content-Type: <doesn't matter>
                <data>

        Upgrade file is save as "upgrade.exe".
        And executed as: upgrade.exe UPGRADE "<current.exe>"

        As far as I can tell no confirmation is requested by Napster when it
        receives this message.  And immediately start to "auto-upgrade". To keep
        users informed that Napster is doing something potentially very harmful
        to their computer it displays a message saying it's "auto-upgrading".

        I think this pretty bad, since all someone has to do is hack a napster
        server et voila a zillion clients at your disposal.

        As far as I known this only affects the Win32 2.0b5a Napster client.
        Other clients/versions I don't know.

6	alternate login format [CLIENT]

	this message is used when logging in for the first time after
	registering (0x07) a nick

	<nick> <pass> <port> "<client-info>" <linkspeed> <email-address>

	note: this message is similar to the 0x02 message, with the addition	
	of <email-address> on the end

	Example:

	foo foo 6699 "nap v0.8" 3 email@here.com

7	client registration message [CLIENT]

	<nick>

	this message is sent to create an account

	response to this message is one of 8, 9 or 10

8	registration success [SERVER]

	the server sends this when the clients request to register a new
	nickname has succeeded.

9	nickname already registered [SERVER]

	the server sends this message when the nickname the client has
	requested has already been registered by another user

10	invalid nickname [SERVER]

	this server sends this message when the client attempts register
	an invalid nickname [what defines an invalid nickname? -ed]

11	??? [CLIENT]

	<nick> <pass>

	[returns "parameters are unparsable" -ed]

12	??? [SERVER]

	no data.

	this message is returned in response to message 11 from the client

14	login options [CLIENT]

	NAME:%s ADDRESS:%s CITY:%s STATE:%s PHONE:%s AGE:%s INCOME:%s EDUCATION:%s

	Example:

	NAME: kev  ADDRESS:  CITY: ephrata  STATE: pa  PHONE:  AGE: 60 or older INCOME: $100,000 or more        EDUCATION: Graduate Degree

100	client notification of shared file [CLIENT]

	"<filename>" <md5> <size> <bitrate> <frequency> <time>

	<md5> see section "MD5"
	<size> is bytes
	<bitrate> is kbps
	<frequency> is hz
	<time> is seconds
	
	Example:

	"generic band - generic song.mp3" b92870e0d41bc8e698cf2f0a1ddfeac7 443332 128 44100 60

102	remove file [CLIENT]

	<filename>

	client requests to remove file from shared library

200	client search request [CLIENT]

    [FILENAME CONTAINS "artist name"] MAX_RESULTS <max> [FILENAME CONTAINS
"song"] [LINESPEED <compare> <link-type>] [BITRATE <compare> "<br>"] [FREQ
<compare> "<freq>"]

        The artist name and the song name are, obviously, treated
                the same by the server; confirm this for yourself
                on the windows client.

        max is a number; if it is greater than 100, the server will
                only return 100 results.

        <compare> is one of the following:
                "AT LEAST" "AT BEST" "EQUAL TO"

        <link-type> see 0x02 (client login) for a description

        <br> is a number, in kbps

        <freq> is a sample frequency, in Hz

        The windows client filters by ping time inside the client.
                It pretty much has to, and it's easy to see the
                result by setting ping time to at best 100 ms or
                so, and max search terms to 50.  You'll get back
                like 3 results, but the client will still tell you
                that it found "50 results".

        Examples:
                FILENAME CONTAINS "Sneaker Pimps" MAX_RESULTS 75 FILENAME
                         CONTAINS "tesko suicide" BITRATE "AT LEAST" "128"

                MAX_RESULTS 100 FILENAME CONTAINS "Ventolin" LINESPEED
                        "EQUAL TO" 10

202	end of search response from server [SERVER]

	no data.

203	download request [CLIENT]

	<nick> "<filename>"

	client requests to download <filename> from <nick>.  client expects
	to make an outgoing connection to <nick> on their specified data
	port.

	Example:

	mred "C:\Program Files\Napster\generic cowboy song.mp3"

	SEE ALSO: 500 alternate download request

204	download ack [SERVER]

205	private message to/from another user [CLIENT, SERVER]

	<nick> <message>

	note the same type is used for a client sending a msg or recieving one

	[Commentary: this message causes problems if you consider linking
	servers together.  With the current one server situation, the server
	just rewrites the message it receives with the name of the client that
	sent it and passes it to the recipient client.  However, in the case
	where the recipient and sender are not on the same server, there is
	loss of information without encapsulating it.  It would have been
	better to put both the sender and recipient because if the servers
	are ever linked they will have to make a new message type for this
	situation.  -ed]

206	get error [SERVER]

	<nick> <filename>

	the server sends this message when the file that the user has
	requested to download is unavailable (such as the user is not logged
	in).

207	add hotlist entry [CLIENT]

	on the hotlist has logged in or out, respectively.

208	hotlist [CLIENT]

	<user>

	This message is used to send the initial list of hotlist entries
	during the initial login process.  It is normally send prior to
	to the add file (100) commands.  To add more entries to the hotlist
	after the initial list is sent, clients should use the 207 message
	instead.

209	user signon [SERVER]

	<user> <speed>

	server is notifying client that a user in their hotlist, <user>,
	has signed on the server with link <speed>

210	user signoff [SERVER]

	<user>

	server is notifying client that a user on their hotlist, <user>, has
	signed off the server.

	this message is also sent by the server when the client attempts to
	browse a nonexistent client.  [why don't they just use 404 for
	this? -ed]

215	request resume [CLIENT]

	<checksum> <filesize>

	client is requesting a list of all users which have the file with
	the characteristics.  the server responds with a list of 216 messages
	for each match, followed by a 217 message to terminate the list

216	resume search response [SERVER]

	<user> <ip> <port> <filename> <checksum> <size> <speed>

	this message contains the matches for the resume request (215).  the

401	part channel [CLIENT, SERVER]

	<channel-name>

	The client sends this command to part a channel.  Server sends this
	message to indicate that the client has parted the channel.  Note
	that this is sometimes sent even when the client has not requested,
	so a client _must_ be prepared to accept it at any time.

402	send public message [CLIENT]

	<channel> <message>

	in this message.  joins that occur after the client has joined will
	be noted by a 406 message.

409	end of channel user list [SERVER]

	<channel>

	this message is sent by the server to indicate it has sent all informati	about the users in a channel

	be used to request files from users who have specified their data
	port as 0 in their login message

501	alternate download ack [SERVER]

	<nick> <ip> <port> "<filename>" <md5> <speed>

	this message is sent to the uploader when their data port is set to

	server: <port>

	This command is used by administrators to request that another
	client set the port used for data transfers to <port>.  The server
	sends a message with the requested port number to the target
	client.  NOTE: the target client can change its port number to
	whatever it wishes using the 703 command.

614	unban user [CLIENT]

	<nick | ip> [ "<reason>" ]

617	list channels [CLIENT, SERVER]

	no data.

	client requests a list of channels on the server.  server responds
	with 618/617

	server indicates end of channel list using this message.

618	channel list entry [SERVER]

	<channel-name> <number-of-users> <topic>

	this is the server response to a 617 client request, one for each
	channel.

	Example:

	Help 50 OpenNap help channel

619	queue limit [CLIENT]

	<nick> "<filename>" <n>

	a client may limit the number of downloads from a particular client.
	once the limit for a particular user has been reached, the uploading
	client can send this message to notify the downloader that they
	have hit the limit and can't have any more simultaneous downloads.
	<nick> is the user who hit the limit, <filename> is the file they
	were trying to download when they hit the limit, and <n> is the
	number of simultaneous downloads allowed.

	Example:

	joebob "C:\MP3\Generic Band - Generic Song.mp3" 3

620	queue limit [SERVER]

	<nick> "<filename>" <filesize> <digit>

	This message is sent by the server in response to the 619 client
	request, when one user needs to notify another that they have
	reached the maximum allowed simultaneous downloads.  When the server
	recieves the 619 request from the uploading client, it sends the 620
	message to the downloading client.  The only difference in format is
	the addition of the <nick> field in the 620 message which specifies
	the username of the uploading agent which is notifying the
	downloader that the queue is full.

	Example:

	joebob "C:\MP3\Generic Band - Generic Song.mp3" 1234567 3

621	message of the day [CLIENT, SERVER]

	<text>

	Server: each 621 message contains a single line of text

	Client: client sends a 621 command with no data to request the
	motd be sent.  The server will usually send this automatically after
	a user logs in, so this command allows a user to reread it upon
	request.

622	muzzle a user [CLIENT]

	<nick> [ "<reason>" ]

	client requests that <nick> not be allowed to send public messages

623	unmuzzle a user [CLIENT]

	<nick> [ "<reason>" ]

	client requests that the enforced silence on <nick> be lifted

624	un-nuke a user [CLIENT]

	<user>

625	change a user's linespeed [CLIENT]

	<user> <speed>

626	data port error [CLIENT, SERVER]

	<user>

	When a downloading client detects that the uploader's data port
	is unreachable, it should send a 626 message to the server with
	the nick of the user for which the connection failed.  The server
	then relays the message to the uploader, substituing the
	downloader's nickname in the message.

627	operator message [CLIENT, SERVER]

	client: <text>
	server: <nick> <text>

	client request to send a message to all admins/moderators

628	global message [CLIENT, SERVER]

	client: <text>
	server: <nick> <text>

	client request send a message to all users

629	banned users [SERVER]

3.  MD5

It looks like the vast majority of the files are hashed using the first
299,008 bytes of the file.  There have been some cases where the hash
matches at 300,032 bytes, but no correlation has been drawn as to when that
happens.  The speculation at this point is that it might have to do with
the existence of a ID3v2 tag, or perhaps the file was sampled at 48kHz...?

The current method seems to be: skip id3v2, seek to frame sync and hash.

Note: the linux nap client (versions 0.7 - 0.9) seem to hash exactly 300,000
bytes, which is NOT what the official windows client does.

4.  Client-Client Protocol

File transfer occur directly between clients without passing through the
server.  There are four transfer modes, upload, download, firewalled upload,
firewalled download.  The normal method of transfer is that the client
wishing to download a file makes a TCP connection to the client holding the
file on their data port.  However, in the case where the client sharing the
file is behind a firewall, it is necessary for them to "push" the data by
making a TCP connection to the downloader's data port.

4.1  Normal Downloading

Regardless of which mode, the downloading client will first issue either a 
search(200) or browse(211) command to the server.  This returns a list of
files and information on the client sharin the file.  To request a download,
a get(203) request is sent to the server.  The server will respond with
a get ack(204) containing more detailed information.

This is the point at which the different methods diverge.  If the 204 get
ack says that the remote clients data port is 0, you must send a 500 request
to the server requesting that the remote client send the data to you.  In
this case you wait for the remote client to connect to your own data port.

In the case where the sharing client is not firewalled, you make a TCP
connection to the data port specified in the 204 message from the server.
The remote client should accept the connection and immediately send one
ASCII char, `1' (ASCII 49).  Once you read this char, you send a request
for the file you wish to download.  First send the string "GET" in a single
packet, then send
	<mynick> "<filename>" <offset>
where <mynick> is your napster user name, <filename> is the file you wish to
download, and <offset> if the byte offst in the file to begin the transfer
at (if you are downloading for the first time, and not resuming a prior
transfer, you should uses 0 to start at the beginning of the file).

The remote client will then return the file size, or an error message such
as "INVALID REQUEST" or "FILE NOT SHARED".  Note that the file size is not
terminated in any special way, and the best way to figure out the size is to
keep reading until you hit a character that is not a digit (it will usually
be 0xff which is the start of the MP3 frame sync header, but if a ID3v2
tag is present it might look different).  Immediately following the file
size is where the data stream for the file begins.

Once the data transfer is initiated, the downloader should notify the server
that they are downloading a file by sending the 218 message.  Once the
transfer is complete, you send a 219 message to indicate you have finished
the download.  Note that this is cummalitive, so that if you are downloading
multiple files, you send one 218/219 pair for EACH concurrent download--this
is how the server knows how many transfers you have going on.  Likewise,
the uploader should send one 220 messge for each upload, and one 221 when
each upload has finished.

4.2  Firwalled Downloading

As described above, when the file needs to be pushed from a client behind a
firewall, the downloader sends a 500 message to the server.  This causes a
501 message to be sent to the uploader, which is similar to the 204 message
for a normal download.

Once the uploader receives the 501 message from the server, they should make
a TCP connection to the downloader's data port (given in the 501 message).
Upon connection, the downloader's client will sent one byte, the ASCII
character `1'.  The uploader should then send the string "SEND" in a single
packet, and then the information:
	<mynick> "<filename>" <size>
where <mynick> is the uploader's napster user name, <filename> is the file
being sent, and <size> is the size of the file in bytes.

Upon receipt, the downloading client will either send the byte offset at
whcih the transfer should start, or an error message such as
"INVALID REQUEST".  The byte offset should be sent as a single packet
in plain ASCII digits.  Just as with above in section 4.1, a 0 byte offset
indicates the transfer should begin at the start of the file.

Each client should notify the server that they are uploading or downloading
with the 218/219 (downloading) or 220/221 (uploading) command pairs (see
section 4.1 for more detailed information).
