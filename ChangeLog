	(if specified in the config file) to avoid parsing the file twice.

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in, README, server_login.c, textdb.c, textdb.h:
	rewrote get_server_pass() to use its own simple parsing routine to fetch the
	password instead of using the textdb_*() functions.

	added support for using different server passwords with each linked server
	rather than always using the value of `server_password'.  if a local
	password is specified in the `servers' it will override the default
	password.

	* napster.txt, opennap.h, privmsg.c:

	the cloak status

	added CLOAK usermode to en/disable the server notifications

	* handler.c, init.c, join.c, login.c, main.c, napster.txt, opennap.h, part.c, public.c, util.c:

	switched to using ISUSER(user->con) instead of testing user->local

	* hash.c, sample.conf:

	and cbanlist.

	added cbanclear to operserv commands

	added the clear channel ban list command (424)

	added the cloak user command (625).  for cloaked users, parts/joins are not
	sent and public messages show up as being from `Operator' instead of the
	real nick that sent it.

	added stub routine for global user list.

	updated patchnap.c for linux nap v1.0 beta

	* FAQ, README, privmsg.c:

	updated protocol spec with additional info from Thomas van der Heijden
	<thom@bart.nl>

	* whois.c:
	consolodated the whois response formation instead of separate commands for
	each case.  now normal users can see whether another user is muzzled

	* login.c, muzzle.c, opennap.h, unmuzzle.c, userdb.c:
	muzzle status is now saved in the user db so that it gets restored when the

	added WALLOP user mode to disable wallops

	use srand() and rand() to generate random numbers instead of hashing input
	data with md5.  the md5 code seems to generate lots of unaligned memory
	accesses on alpha, and it really isnt critical to have cryptographic quality
	random numbers.  it should also reduce the cpu usage since it no longer has
	to hash all input.

	* join.c:
	added support for automatic creation of rollover channels for predefined
	channels

	moved the list of shared files into the USEROPT struct since it only needs
	to be present for locally connected users

	change_pass(), alter_pass() and nuke() should releay the command to other
	servers before checking if the account is locally registered, since the
	userdb may not be entirely replicated

	userdb_dump() sould unlink() User_Db_Path before calling rename() since it
	causes an error under win32

	* change.c:
	the server-server message for change_pass() did not contain the user who
	changed the password

2000-04-09  drscholl  <drscholl@users.sourceforge.net>

	* handler.c, join.c, kick.c, opennap.h:
	added the clear channel (820) command

2000-04-08  drscholl  <drscholl@users.sourceforge.net>

	* handler.c:
	handle_connection() should send the USER_SHARING message prior to execution
	of the callback so that the proper information is sent to users when the
	user joins a channel for the first time.

	* free_user.c, handler.c, init.c:
	Local_Files was not decremented in free_user()

	added sig handler to call md_cleanup() on SIGUSR1

	fixed core in update_stats() on new log message for number of local files

	login timer was not set on server connections

	* README, handler.c, privmsg.c:
	added the config and reconfig commands to OperServ

	that if a user does not issue any more commands after sharing/unsharing,
	the information will not get passed to the peer servers

	* add_file.c, handler.c, opennap.h, remove_file.c:
	add_file()/remove_file() now set a flag in the USER struct.
	handle_connection() then checks for the end of the share/unshare messags
	from the client by checking for a command other than share/unshare and
	passes the final results to the peer servers

2000-04-07  drscholl  <drscholl@users.sourceforge.net>

	* add_file.c, main.c, opennap.h, remove_file.c, resume.c:
	server now keeps track of how many files are available from local users
	and displays this info in update_stats()

	removed prototypes for outdated functions from opennap.h

	* add_file.c, join.c, kick.c, login.c, main.c, muzzle.c, napster.txt, opennap.h, remove_file.c, serverlib.c, synch.c:
	created new util functions nosuchchannel() and unparsable()

	channel_limit() now only checks for privilege for local users so that the
	limits can be synced by servers when linking

	* README, userdb.c, util.c:
	updated installation instructions

	userdb_init() should only rewind() if the first line doesn't contain the
	version information

	log() no longer prefixes messages with `opennap: '

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in, buffer.c, handler.c, main.c, mkpass.c, mkpass.dsp, network.c, opennap.dsp, opennap.dsw, opennap.h, opennap.opt, opennap.plg, serverlib.c, snprintf.c, util.c:
	added mkpass project to win32 workspace

	created new macro N_ERRNO to be used in place of error when checking error
	conditions from socket related function calls.  win32 uses h_errno so this
	should be used as a wrapper to make the code cleaner

	added new macro nlogerr() which is like logerr() but should be used when
	priting errors from socket related functions

	* TODO, login.c:
	major cleanup of login().  password should not be checked until after the
	check for a user already logged in to prevent password guessing

	* Makefile.in, kick.c, main.c, search.c:
	missing channel name in the notify_mods() call in kick()

	ignore "rock" and "new" in search strings

	* NEWS, README, config.c, configure, configure.in, main.c, opennap.h, sample.conf, search.c:

	added login timeout detection.  default is to close client connections if
	they have no logged in within 60 seconds

	added "me", "to" and "rock" to the list of words to ignore in the search
	table since over 5000 entries were detected

2000-04-06  drscholl  <drscholl@users.sourceforge.net>

	* change.c, opennap.h:
	allow nuke_user() to take an optional reason for the revocation

	* login.c:
	delay setting the user's level from the db until after the notify_mods()
	call so that the user is not notified twice of their change in status.

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in, config.c, handler.c, join.c, kick.c, list_channels.c, login.c, main.c, napster.txt, opennap.h, part.c, privmsg.c, sample.conf, server_usage.c:

	updated napster.txt with new protocol findings

2000-04-05  drscholl  <drscholl@users.sourceforge.net>

	* browse.c, main.c:
	data.max was not initialized to 0 in browse() causing a problem with
	browsing users on the same server

	* login.c, main.c:
	reorganized the login() routine to allows privileged users to bypass the
	max_connections restriction

	should check for -1 instead of EOF in getopt() test

	* add_file.c, search.c:
	modification to use the soundex hash as the key for the File_Table.  This
	should decrase the amount of memory required for searching at the expense of
	a little cpu, but should not affect the search results since it still uses
	the same token based scheme once the smallest bin has been found.

2000-04-04  drscholl  <drscholl@users.sourceforge.net>

	* main.c:
	update_stats() now prints out the number of entries in the File_Table hash
	table to get an idea of its size

	* mkpass.c, search.c, serverlib.c:
	added copyright notice to mkpass.c and serverlib.c

	tokenize() should ignore the words "of", "you" and "mp3's" because of the
	high use of these words (>10,000 hits).

	* ban.c:
	issue a kill if we receive a login command from a remote server for a
	locally banned user

	/msg opserver ...

	* userdb.c:
	removed check for .nuked in dump_userdb()

	* change.c, handler.c, login.c:

	order to avoid server loops

	* Makefile.in, ban.c, handler.c, login.c, main.c, opennap.h:
	removed check_accept() function.  the maximum connections is now enforced by
	login() to avoid the situation where servers can't link because the number
	of client connections has exceeded the maximum

	accept_connection() now calls check_ban() directly

2000-03-30  drscholl  <drscholl@users.sourceforge.net>

	* handler.c, muzzle.c, network.c, privmsg.c, public.c, search.c, server_login.c, synch.c:
	the long line truncation in public/emote needs to calculate the length based
	upon the start of the data actually sent to the client.  server->server
	messages were being truncated in the _next_ packet.

2000-03-28  drscholl  <drscholl@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ChangeLog, NEWS, README, opennap.h:
	win32 needs _POSIX_PATH_MAX defined to compile

	them

	* public.c, spyserv.c:
	don't allow public or emote commands longer than 128 chars to prevent the
	DOS attack against the windows napster client.

	* main.c:
	listen fd needs to be set to nonblocking so the loop over accept() doesn't
	block the server.

	* ban.c, login.c, main.c:
	modified accept_connection() to loop until accept() returns an error

	cli->destroy should be set in check_accept when max connections has been
	reached.

2000-03-27  drscholl  <drscholl@users.sourceforge.net>

	* TODO, change.c, join.c, util.c:
	only call notify_mods() if a users data port is set to a different value
	than what is currently set to

	join should send a 408 back to the user than joined, and not a 406.

	split_line() now breaks on space, tab, cr or lf to separate words

	* ban.c, change.c, config.c, init.c, level.c, login.c, main.c, opennap.h, userdb.c, whois.c:
	changed user db into an memory-based hash table to improve performance.
	the user db is dumped to disk every `user_db_interval' seconds (default:
	1800)

	* configure, configure.in, main.c, remove_connection.c:
	remove support for poll() since it doesnt work well

2000-03-26  drscholl  <drscholl@users.sourceforge.net>

	* main.c, util.c:
	moved complete_connect() call to final loop to avoid altering Num_Clients in
	the read loop

	* main.c, util.c:
	poll() still returns EINVAL under linux so the main loop now always shifts
	down the CONNECTION pointeres to fill all holes.

2000-03-25  drscholl  <drscholl@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ban.c, login.c, main.c, opennap.h:

	bail out without doing anything if the user level is set to the level that
	was requested

	* main.c:
	need to reset the CLient id when shifting down the entries to fill gaps

	* main.c:
	modified main() loop to reduce the size of the Clients array if there are
	more than 10 holes in it.  this is to try and prevent EINVAL under linux,
	which does a sanity check to make sure the nfds arg is smaller than the
	current number of open fds

	* main.c:
	added debugging to find error with poll() call

2000-03-23  drscholl  <drscholl@users.sourceforge.net>

2000-03-16  drscholl  <drscholl@users.sourceforge.net>

	* add_file.c, announce.c, ban.c, buffer.c, change.c, download.c, free_user.c, handler.c, join.c, kill_user.c, level.c, login.c, main.c, muzzle.c, opennap.h, part.c, public.c, remove_connection.c, remove_file.c, search.c, server_connect.c, server_links.c, server_login.c, server_usage.c, topic.c, unmuzzle.c, util.c:
	made the server list a real LIST instead of an array.  removed global
	Num_Servers.  pass_message_args() will now return without doing anything if

2000-03-15  drscholl  <drscholl@users.sourceforge.net>

	* level.c:
	fixed broken log message causing a segfault

	* handler.c, login.c, opennap.h:
	added register_user() command (10200) to allow admins to force registration
	of user accounts

	* login.c:
	user_ip() should use strtoul() to convert the string ip into an integer.

	* join.c, login.c, server_connect.c, server_login.c:
	modified join() to alloc the memory required before sending any messages to
	clients so that if memory runs out we can recover the state.

	server_connect() should allow duplicate connects to the same host on
	different ports.

	user_ip() should case the result of strtol() to unsigned int.

	server_login() should notify local admins when another server attempts to
	join

2000-03-12  drscholl  <drscholl@users.sourceforge.net>

	* login.c:
	register_nick() should only fail if the user is already logged in.

2000-03-11  drscholl  <drscholl@users.sourceforge.net>

	* search.c:
	need to keep a local flag in the DSEARCH struct for use with checking where
	to send the final ACK in remote_search_end.  if the local user logs off then
	search->con will be invalid so we can't use ISUSER(search->con) to decide.

2000-03-10  drscholl  <drscholl@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in, configure, handler.c, opennap.spec, sample.servers, sample.users, textdb.c:
	handle_connection() should loop around read() when getting a packet header
	since some clients send it in two pieces

	added sample users and servers files, and a rpm spec file for building a
	binary package for Red Hat users.

	* handler.c:
	fixed partial packet header reading again.

	* handler.c:
	fix to read the packet header in multiple pieces

	* handler.c:
	check to see if 4 bytes of the header have been read after the initial
	read

	* handler.c:
	write a nul (\0) char at the end of the data in handle_connection() when
	an error is detected so that the log message is readable

	* handler.c:
	tag and len should be unsigned short integers

	* add_file.c:
	fix to abort nicely if the user hash table can't be allocated

	* buffer.c, handler.c, main.c, opennap.h, remove_connection.c:
	rewrote input handler to avoid allocating a new buffer every time data is
	read.  instead, a single buffer is reused and extended if required.  all
	input is processed as it is read now instead of breaking the reading and
	processing into two steps.

	* list.c, list.h:
	added macro LIST_NEW() as a wrapper around list_new() so that it gets
	inlined when DEBUG is turned on.

2000-03-09  drscholl  <drscholl@users.sourceforge.net>

	* hotlist.c:
	fixed hotlist bug.  the hotlist entry was not being removed from the user's
	personal list in the CONNECTION struct

	* hotlist.c, opennap.h:
	more debugging to find the hotlist problem.

	* README, hotlist.c, list.c, list.h, sample.conf, util.c:
	added list_validate() function to be used in tracking down the hotlist bug

	* hotlist.c, opennap.h, remove_connection.c, util.c:
	simplified hotlist removal code by calling list_delete() instead of
	iterating through the list.

	need to set con->uopt.hotlist to 0 after call list_free() to avoid ASSERTing
	in cancel_search()

	* list.c:
	called FREE on the wrong pointer in list_delete()

	* util.c:
	seed the random number context with as many bytes as are read, even if less
	than requested.

	* add_file.c, hotlist.c:
	forgot to set hotlist->magic when creating a new entry

	forgot to set list->data when adding a file to the db

	* add_file.c, hotlist.c, join.c, list.c, list.h, remove_connection.c, search.c, textdb.c, userdb.c:
	removed all use of list_new() and list_append() to track down the memory
	leak.  the debug info should now show where the leaked memory is being
	allocated.

	* napster.txt, opennap.h, remove_connection.c, search.c, util.c:
	[napster.txt] changed text for 404 message to describe it as a generic error message

	[util.c] split_line should eat extra whitespace between fields

	when a local user quits, any pending searches should be marked as invalid so
	that when the results come back the ->con pointer in the DSEARCH structure
	is not used.
	rather than for a specific value.

	* search.c:
	should have compiled before committing the last fix.

	* search.c:
	duplicate tokens should not be added to the list in tokenize(). this makes
	the search function return the same file multiple times.

	* change.c, debug.c, join.c, list.c, login.c, main.c, part.c:
	reformatted some code with indent

	fixed memory leak in reginfo() where userdb_free() was not called.

	* add_file.c, debug.c:
	commented out memory dump from debug_cleanup()

	reformatted the code in add_file.c

2000-03-08  drscholl  <drscholl@users.sourceforge.net>

	* login.c:
	db->lastSeen was set from get_level() when it should be atol()

	* login.c:
	db->nick was not set when creating a new db entry in reginfo()

	* download.c, login.c, resume.c, search.c, synch.c, upload_complete.c:
	changed most instances of %lu to %u since we only use 32-bit integers.

	* opennap.h, search.c, util.c, handler.c, main.c:
	only use /dev/random to seed the random context.  on servers the system
	random pool gets eaten up too fast.

	* debug.c, search.c, server_login.c, userdb.c:
	fixed to handle generate_search_id() returning NULL.

2000-03-07  drscholl  <drscholl@users.sourceforge.net>

	* util.c:
	add_client did not set the .id member when growing the array.

	* login.c:
	user->pass was not free'd if there was an error during login

	* debug.c, join.c:
	no need to test for block->file being NULL when we are only referencing
	a static memory block.

	muzzled users should not be allowed to join chat channels

	* debug.c:
	debug code doesn't need to strdup() the file passed in, it can simply
	reference it since it is static memory.

	got rid of the .prev pointer in the BLOCK struct.  we can walk the list of
	block with a BLOCK** pointer instead.

	* TODO, download.c, upload_complete.c:
	fixed upload_ok() to use send_user() instead of send_cmd() since the
	downloader could be on a remote server.

	removed PostgreSQL from the TODO list since we no longer use a SQL db.

	* announce.c, kill_user.c, main.c, opennap.h, remove_connection.c, search.c, server_links.c, upload_complete.c, util.c:
	Modified the main loop to stop shifiting down the CONNECTION array to fill
	the holes.  add_client() will insert new connections into the holes, or
	grow the array if its all full.  Added new global Max_Clients which should
	be used in any contruct that needs to loop over all local connections,
	avoiding the entries that are set to NULL (holes).

	* buffer.c, main.c:
	use a new local variable numClients for the loop test constructs since
	Num_Clients gets changed by the accept_connection().  this may be the cause
	of all those immediate disconnects.

	* search.c:
	use a faster algorithm for walking the list when deleting invalid entries
	from the files list

	* search.c:
	tokenize() should ignore common words because they are not useful in
	searching

	fdb_collect_garbage() will now print messages about bins with more than
	10,000 entries so that they can be considered for addition to the ignore
	list

	* AUTHORS, configure.in, init.c, main.c, network.c, opennap.h, timer.c:
	solaris port (jones@users.sourceforge.net)

	* add_file.c, browse.c, client_quit.c, download.c, handler.c, opennap.h, remove_file.c, server_login.c, synch.c, upload_complete.c, util.c, whois.c:
	added the ability to download files and browse users on other servers

	server stats for users/files/size is again global for all linked servers

	server message are no longer automatically forwarded by handle_connection().
	each handler is now responsible for forwarding the message if necessary.

	implemented the ability to search on remote servers so that the entire file
	database isn't replicated on every server.

	several of the server query functions now take an optional server argument
	to get the status of a remote server rather than the one the client is
	connected to.

	* sample.conf, config.c, init.c, main.c, network.c, opennap.h:
	added max_data_size and max_rss_size configuration variables to adjust
	sytem limits on memory usage per process

	* opennap.h, textdb.c, util.c:
	added `#define USE_CRLF 1' for use on win32 to write \r\n at the end of each
	line in the database

	modified next_arg() to use space, \r, \n and \t as word separators, and to
	set the argument to 0 when hitting the \0 in the source string to avoid
	returning an extra empty string

	* Makefile.in, add_file.c, ban.c, buffer.c, configure, configure.in, hotlist.c, login.c, main.c, opennap.h, public.c, server_connect.c, server_login.c, synch.c, textdb.c, timer.c, userdb.c, util.c:
	created logerr() macro as a wrapper for libc errors

	used OUTOFMEMORY() macro when memory errors occur

	don't use next_arg() in public() because it will strip leading space from
	the user's message

	switch to using LIST instead of arrays for many things which don't need to
	be directly indexed.

	optimized USER and CONNECTION structs to require as little memory as
	possible.

	* main.c, opennap.h:
	optimized fields in the DATUM struct to be as small as possible

	* TODO, add_file.c, hotlist.c, opennap.h, search.c:
	added -DLESSMEMORY to force the server to regenerate the token list when
	comparing rather than storing it in the database

	* main.c, timer.c:

	timer is scheduled

	* network.c:
	need to include sys/time.h before sys/resouce.h on bsdi

	* main.c, opennap.h, timer.c:
	added next_timer() function to give the time at which the next pending event
	is scheduled.  the main even loop in the server should never block for
	longer than when a pending even is scheduled

	* ChangeLog, Makefile.am, Makefile.in, ban.c, init.c, join.c, main.c, opennap.h, timer.c:
	added timer functions for scheduling periodic events (colten edwards)

	added global variable Current_Time which is set once per iteration of the

	add_hotlist()

	* init.c:
	handle SIGPIPE to avoid terminating the process when writing to a connection

	added additional debugging output to the add_file() and associated
	routines

	* main.c:

	fixes to compile cleanly with debugging turned off

	* browse.c, search.c:
	allow max_browse_result to be 0 to indicate unlimited

	added additional debugging to free_flist()

2000-02-29  drscholl  <drscholl@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.in, handler.c, init.c, main.c, opennap.h, Makefile.am:
	main.c was getting too big. broke out initialization code into init.c and
	connection handling code into handler.c

	* ChangeLog, main.c, network.c:
	added support for the opennap server to listen on port 8889 to report stats
	about the server to interested parties

	check for out of memory errors in tokenize()

2000-02-28  drscholl  <drscholl@users.sourceforge.net>

	* add_file.c, ban.c, config.c, configure, configure.in, main.c, network.c, opennap.h, sample.conf:
	allow max_shared to be 0 to allow unlimited sharing

	added new config vars 'uid' and 'gid' to specify the uid/gid to switch to

	restored sharing of multimedia files.

	* ChangeLog:
	updated ChangeLog with recent changes

	* buffer.c, main.c:
	modified buffer_compress() to allocate one 16k output buffer and compresss
	as much data as will fit in it.  this is necessary since queue_data() can
	now produce multiple 16k buffer chunks for server connections.

2000-02-25  drscholl  <drscholl@users.sourceforge.net>

	* main.c:
	changed listen() queue backlog to a value of 50

	* README, main.c, opennap.h, server_usage.c:
	added number of global users, server start time, and server uptime to the
	10115 server stats reply

	* kill_user.c:
	should set user->con->destroy=1 when killing a local user, not con->destroy

	* main.c, search.c:
	if multiple FILENAME CONTAINS clauses are specified, treat them as an
	implicit AND operation

	* Makefile.in, main.c, opennap.h, search.c:
	added a garbage collection routine to run every 60 seconds to free up memory
	associated with invalid entries

	added new command 10112 to show the server links (colten edwards)

	* AUTHORS, ChangeLog, Makefile.am, Makefile.in, debug.c, debug.h, main.c, opennap.h, server_usage.c:
	added a new command 10115 for getting some useful information about the
	server (colten edwards)

	* upload_complete.c:
	upload_ok() was looking in the downloader's hash table for the file info,
	should be the uploader's table

	* main.c:
	forgot to uncomment the free_hash() on the File_Table

	* search.c:
	nick was printed using %d instead of %s when returing search results

	* search.c:
	fdb_search() should return if it can't find a search token in the hash table
	since we can be sure there are no matches

	* search.c: fixed bug in fdb_search()

	* ChangeLog, whois.c:
	minor whois change

	* browse.c, buffer.c, change.c, config.c, configure, configure.in, db.c, debug.c, debug.h, download.c, free_user.c, hash.c, login.c, main.c, opennap.h, remove_file.c, resume.c, search.c, server_connect.c, server_login.c, synch.c, upload_complete.c, util.c, add_file.c:
	wrote new database for storing the library.  we now use a hash table based
	on word tokens in the filename, with a list of files for each word

	modified malloc debugger to use a hash table to store the allocation
	information because a single list was too slow for large amounts of data

	modified buffer_queue() to allocate chunks of memory and allocate a new
	buffer in the list if there is not enough room to append, instead of using
	realloc.  this should improve performace

	began adding extra checks for when we run out of memory so that we can
	recover gracefully.

2000-02-24  drscholl  <drscholl@users.sourceforge.net>

	* main.c:
	we should force a call to send_queued_data() in main() if the connection is
	about to be shut down.  in this case we write as much as we can before we
	close the socket.

	* main.c:
	no longer necessary to check for existence of the client pointer because
	it won't be removed except by the main() routine itself.

	* buffer.c, kill_user.c, login.c, main.c, opennap.h, remove_connection.c, server_connect.c:
	remove_connection() should now only be called from the main() routine.
	other functions that wish the client connection to be shut down should
	set the .destroy memory to a nonzero value.

	* whois.c, change.c:
	username was printed out using %d instead of %s in alter_port()

	the whois response now inclues the server the user is connected to if the
	user level of the client issuing the request is admin+

	* buffer.c:
	send_queued_data() should call buffer_free() on the output buffer before
	calling remove_connection()

	* buffer.c, main.c:
	send_queued_data() should call remove_connection() instead of setting
	con->destroy=1 since it is safe to free the CONNECTION pointer at
	that point.

2000-02-23  drscholl  <drscholl@users.sourceforge.net>

	* download.c: more logging in download()

	* buffer.c, client_quit.c, download.c, free_user.c, remove_file.c:

	fixed download() to send the correct 203 command when the uploader is
	firewalled.

	added log messages for sending/receving client quit messages

	* download.c:
	queue_limit() should check for mysql_num_rows() > 0 before calling
	mysql_fetch_row()

	* client_quit.c, download.c, kill_user.c, napster.txt:
	fixed client_quit() to avoid calling hash_remove() when it detects a QUIT for
	a local user

	* ChangeLog, main.c:
	send_queued_data() should be called if there is uncompressed data waiting to
	be sent to the server

	* client_quit.c, download.c, kill_user.c, login.c, main.c, remove_file.c, upload_complete.c:
	reformatted log() messages for the upload/download functions

	* login.c, main.c:
	alter_port() was not listed in the handler callback table

	* download.c, kill_user.c:
	download() should use validate_user() instead of just VALID()

	use next_arg() in kill_user() instead of plain strchr()

	* buffer.c, change.c:
	fixed buffer_uncompress() to set .datamax when calling realloc().

	* ChangeLog, buffer.c, opennap.h:
	modified buffer_queue() to allocate memory in 1k chunks to avoid calling
	realloc() too often

	modified buffer_compress() to allocate memory in 2k chunks to avoid calling
	realloc() too often

	* ChangeLog, network.c, opennap.h, server_login.c:
	set SO_SNDBUF and SO_RCVBUF to 16k for server-server tcp connections

	* ChangeLog, change.c, opennap.h:
	added support for 613 command for admin to alter the data port the client is
	listening on (only works with the win32 clients)

	calls to write() should check for EWOULDBLOCK to avoid closing the
	connection unnecessarily

	added max_browse_result config variable to control the maxium number of
	entries returned on a /browse command (default 1500)

	allow max_search_result to be 0 to allow for arbitrary size searches

	* public.c:
	fixed bug where the first char of a public message gets chopped off

	* db.c, login.c, public.c, resume.c:
	reduced max filename size to 150 to try to avoid mysqld crashes.

	fixed bug in resume() where the md5 attribute was not quoted in the SQL
	query.

	change order in login() to wait until after the login/email ack has been
	sent before sending the notification of the user level being changed to
	avoid breaking the win32 client.

2000-02-19  drscholl  <drscholl@users.sourceforge.net>

	* download.c:
	functions that call transfer_wrapper() need to check the return value

	pointer.  this is only necessary when destroying the connection for the
	source of the message being processed.  destroying other connections is
	perfectly fine.

	buffer_uncompress() should allocate 1 extra byte similar to buffer_read()
