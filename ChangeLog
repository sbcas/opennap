Changes from 0.01
=================
send_cmd() modified to take the CONNECTION struct instead of a file descriptor

modified send_cmd() and pass_message() to call new function queue_data()
instead of write().  to avoid blocking on write() calls, the server now
queues all messages it has to send for one pass on the event loop.  after all
input has been processed, queued data is sent.  send_queued_data() takes note
of how much data was actually sent and saves the rest for the next event
loop.

the server now requires mutual authentication for establishing a
server<->server link.

changed authentication such that the server passwords never travel over the net
in the clear.  this will prevent bogus servers from trying to steal a server's
password.  instead, we use a scheme similar to apop where one server issues
a challenge for which the other use will hash their password with and send
back the hash value.  except in this case both parties generate a random
"nonce" value which seeds the hash.
