* flood control

  need some way to prevent the user from flooding the server.  this is a
  problem since when the user first connects they will likely send a large
  amount of valid information about the contents of their mp3 library

* add a list users command (found numeric, still need to find the format)

* server linking is still blocking for some reason, even thought the socket
  is set nonblocking before the connect() call

* add a timeout to check for blocked server connect() call

* rewrite server db to use two passwords for each server

* allow channels file to accept the default level as either a word or the
  number

* find the server output for the global users list

* find numerics for server ignore/unignore
