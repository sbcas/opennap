* flood control

  need some way to prevent the user from flooding the server.  this is a
  problem since when the user first connects they will likely send a large
  amount of valid information about the contents of their mp3 library

* add a timeout to check for blocked server connect() call

* create a list of servernames with refcounts to conserve memory for the
  user->server field
