opennap v0.24 (ALPHA)
the open source (TM) napster server
=====================
March 30, 2000

IRC: #opennap on irc.openprojects.net
Email: opennap-dev@lists.sourceforge.net

opennap is an Open Source(TM) server implementation of the popular
Napster protocol.  It is written in ANSI C and was designed to run on Unix
platforms.  So far this server has only been tested on:
	* Linux (i386 and alpha)
	* BSDI
	* FreeBSD
	* Solaris
	* OS/2
	* Windows 2000 (MS VC++)
	* Windows NT 4.0 (MS VC++)
Minimal porting should be required for compilation on other Unix variants
(if you do a port, please send patches to drscholl@users.sourceforge.net)

Since Napster is not an open specification, much of the internals of the
servers are specific to this implementation.  In particular, I don't expect
that this server will interoperate with the official Napster servers once they
are linked together.  Given that I can't run tcpdump between those servers,
I can't see how they are communicating.  I'm hoping that with the proliferation
of servers outside of napster.com, they might be willing to open up their
specification to make sure all the clients can interoperate.  However, this
server should be compliant with the several currently available Unix Napster
clients.

Main differences from the official napster servers:
* servers can be linked together
* normal users can create channels
* source code is freely available

What's included?
* opennap server
* metaserver for directing clients to server groups
* protocol specification
* SOURCE CODE!

There is also a mailing list opennap-admin@lists.sourceforge.net for people
running live servers to share information not directly related to the
development of the server.

* For a description of the napster protocol, please see the file 'napster.txt'
  included with this distribution.

* INSTALLATION

  1.  build and install opennap
  2.  create at least one elite (server operator) nick to use on the server

	edit /usr/local/share/opennap/users
	add:
		<nick> <password> <email> elite 0 0

      where <nick> is the nick you want to use, <pass> is the password for
      the nick, and <email> is your email address (optional, but it must not
      be empty).

      When you log into the server with your client, you should see a
      message from the server:

      * Server: <server name> set your level to Elite (4).

* Linking Servers

  1.  you need to add the dns name of the server you wish to allow to connect
      to your server in the database.  This needs to be done on both
      ends, as it does mutual authentication to prevent bogus servers from
      being able to join.

	edit /usr/local/share/opennap/servers
	add:
		<server name> <password>

	where <server name> is the dns name of the server, and <password>
	is the password for that server to gain access.

   2.  connect to your server and gain elite access, and execute the
       `server connect' command (currently only BWap has support for
       the opennap commands), specifying the host and port to connect to.

       In BWap, you would do:
       /admin connect <server> <port>

* OperServ

Since many existing Napster clients can't be extended to make use of the few
opennap specific commands, a pseudo user named OperServ was created which
only responds to private messages from users of level Moderator or above (it
is invisible in all other ways).  It currently supports the following
commands:

	chanlevel
	register
	connect
	disconnect
	killserver
	links
	stats

See below in the section `Non-standard messages' for a descripton of the
syntax for these commands.

* Server to Server messages

There are many cases where client commands need to be passed to peer servers
in order to maintain database consistency across all servers.  However, most
of the commands that the clients use don't specify the user who performed
the action.  This implementation borrows from the IRC protcol and prefixes
client commands with
	:user
to indicate to peer servers which user issued the command.  Commands which
already specify the user name, such as the login request (2), are not
prefixed.  Each request handler should have a comment at the beginning
specifying what input it expects.

* Extensions to messages

200	search [CLIENT]

	SOUNDEX CONTAINS "..."

		soundex is a way of (loosely) hashing words to find words
		that "sound" similar.  opennap supports searching for files
		in this manner

	TYPE <mime-type>

		opennap supports other media types besides mp3.  by default,
		searches will only match mp3 files.  a client can however
		search for other media typs by specify either a full or
		partial MIME content-type, such as "video" or "image/jpeg"
		(see message 10300 for adding media to the database).  The
		special keyword `any' will match any media type in the
		database.

		The results of the search are returned as with mp3, except
		the fields for bitrate, sample frequency and length are
		meaningless (and are set to 0 in this implmentation).  The
		client can then download as they would any other mp3 file.

* Non-standard messages

The following messages are not present in the official napster servers, but
are implemented as additional functionality in the opennap server.

10000	client quit [SERVER]

	<nick>

	the message is sent to peer servers when a client connection has
	closed

10010	server login [SERVER]

	<server-name> <nonce> <compression>

	<server-name>	the dns name of the server wishing to connect
	<nonce>		a random string to use for authentication
	<compression>	the maximum zip (LZ77) compression level

	this message is sent when a connection wishes to identify itself as
	a peer server.  when a server receives this message, it will send its
	own login command to the peer to initial mutual authentication

10011	server login ack [SERVER]

	<hash-response>

	to authenticate itself, the server will hash the value
		<peer-nonce><nonce><server-pass>
	using the MD5 algorithm.  this allows the servers to mutually
	authenticate without the plaintext passwords traversing the network

10013	user ip [SERVER]

	<user> <ip> <port> <server>

	this message is used for a server to pass the ip address of a
	locally connected client to its peer servers, since that information
	is not available in the login message.  <ip> is an unsigned long
	integer specifying the ip address for <user>

10014	registration info [SERVER]

	<user> <pass> <level> <email> <created> <last-seen>

	<pass>		user's password
	<level>		user's default level
	<email>		user's email address
	<created>	time at which the account was created
	<last-seen>	last time the user logged into a server

	When a server detects that the user table is out of sync between
	servers, it will send its notion of what the entry should look like
	to all the other servers.  If a receiving server has a matching
	user, it checks the <created> time to see which is the oldest
	entry and updates accordingly.

10019	server link info [SERVER]

	<server> <port> <server> <port> <hops> <bufsize>

	This message is used by servers to share information about the
	topology of the linked servers.  when a server joins, a message is
	sent to all other nodes in the cluster.  <hops> is incremented each
	time the message is relayed so that each server knows how far away
	the others are.

10020	server quit [SERVER]

	:<server> <server> "<reason>"

	This message is used to notify other servers in the group that a
	server has delinked.  The server with the peer connection to the
	server that has quit should send this message.

10100	server connect [CLIENT]

	<server> <port> [ <remote_server> ]

	attempts to link the current server to <server>:<port>.  if
	<remote_server> is given, then that server attempts to make the
	link.  this command can be executed by admin level and higher.

10101	server disconnect [CLIENT]

	<server> <reason> [ <remote-server> ]

	delink current server from <server>.
	must be admin or high level to execute this command

10110	kill server [CLIENT]

	<server> <reason>

	cause the server to shutdown.  must be elite level to execute
	this command.

10111	remove server [CLIENT]

	<server> <reason>

	reqeusts that <server> be removed from the table of allowed links.
	must be elite to execute this command

10112	show server links [CLIENT, SERVER]

	client: no data
	server: <host> <host> <hops>

	This command is used to show information about the links a
	server has to other servers.  The list is terminated by a 10112
	message with no data (0 length).

10115	show server stats [CLIENT, SERVER]

	server: <clients> <servers> <files> <gigs> <channels> <time> <uptime> <memory>

	This command is used by administrators to get information about the
	state of the server.

	<clients>	number of locally connected clients
	<servers>	number of locally connected servers
	<users>		total number of global users
	<files>		number of files in the db
	<gigs>		total size of all files shared
	<channels>	number of active channels
	<time>		time at which the server was started
	<uptime>	number of seconds of uptime
	<memory>	if debugging is enabled, this will show the memory
			currently in use, otherwise it will be -1

10118	encapsulated message [SERVER]

	:<sender> <recip> <message>

	This command allows a server to send a private message to a user on
	a remote server.  <message> should be a well-formed Napster message,
	complete with tag and length header.

10201	set channel level [CLIENT]

	<channel> <level>

	sets the minimum user level required to enter <channel> to <level>.

	Example:

	Operators Moderator

	sets channel "Operators" such that only users with level moderator
	or above may join the channel.

10300	share generic media file [CLIENT]

	"<filename>" <size> <md5> <content-type>

	<content-type> is the MIME type defined for what the data is.  This
			should be of the form TYPE/SUBTYPE, where TYPE is
			one of: audio, video, text, image, application

	Examples:

	"C:\IMAGES\Grand Canyon.jpg" 54187 bc938fdc0ef63772bfbdbf57aabb0860-54187 image/jpeg
	"\home\drscholl\src\opennap-0.11.tar.gz" 102161 51c07734811a26853b1a2a87b67c68a1-102161 application/x-gunzip
